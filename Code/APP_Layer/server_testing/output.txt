I'm not a ladies man, I'm a land mine
Filming my own fake death
Under an '88 Cavalier I go
But-but-but-but nothing but the rear bumper's blown
But I's born for this flight
United 955 on the fifth of July
Back to SFO
I-I join the dark side
In a thin disguise
On consumer grade video at night

Faking s
UniQuicide for applause
In the food courts of malls
And cursing racing horses on church steps
Playing thradeÅe wall at singles bingo
All-time gringo
Did anyone hear me cry there?
Through a toilet stall dividere fifth of JÄ
I swear I care, raw

Am I an example of a calculated birth?
To a star chart for clowns, I'm not
Under robin eggs in a nest, you hit a manila envelope
With one last little robin's egg in it
A hollow bchar!ullet yet spent
Subject to dismissal
I wish all my pitfalls
Could be caught by this call

Cheeri-a, es o1cheeri-e, cheeri-i, cheeri-o, cheeri-u
