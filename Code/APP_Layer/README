Team:
Travis Collins traviscollins@wpi.edu
James Silvia jsilvia11@wpi.edu

Operational:

Commands:
-send
-who
-what
-login
-get
-upload

Notes:
All layers are fully independent running in their own threads and purely interact with one another through a series of queues.

The team's server is a able to handle multiple users, though no more than three have been truly tested.

Interms of error introduction, the system generally can work up to 40% probability error introduction.  At 50% it is generally unstable.

The team has successfully transferred files over 1-Megabyte in size to and from the server and clients.	

Due to CCC server installability the team was force to greatly increase its timeout periods.  The severe load on the CCC servers cause massive latency issues.

Usage:
-Server must be started first

./server <verbose enable> <port>

./client <server> login <username> <age> <location> <hobby> <verbose> <port> <probability (0-10)>
