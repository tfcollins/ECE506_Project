The server is located in /server
		-use make server
		-make clean to cleanup
	client is located in /client

The client accepts "help" and prints out user usage, will also
print on incorrect input to the client.

Notes:
All layers are fully independent running in their own threads and 
purely interact with one another through a series of queues.

The team's server is able to handle multiple users, though no more 
than three have been truly tested.

In terms of error introduction, the system generally can work up to 40% 
probability error introduction.  At 50% it is generally unstable.

The team has successfully transferred files over 1-Megabyte in size to 
and from the server and clients.	

Due to CCC server instability the team was force to greatly increase its 
timeout periods.  The severe load on the CCC servers cause massive latency issues.

Usage:
-Server must be started first

./server <verbose enable> <port>
-verbose enable and port are optional inputs

./client <server> login <username> <age> <location> <hobby> <verbose> <port> <probability (0-10)>
-verbose, port, and probability are optional inputs
-probability (0-10) is configured such that 1->10% error.
