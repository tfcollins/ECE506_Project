travi s said:A looper, you know, a caddy, a looper, a jock. So, I tell them I'm a pro jock, and who do you  think they give me? The Dalai Lama, himself. Twelfth son of the Lama. The flowing robes, the grace,  bald... striking. So, I'm on the first tee with him. I give him the driver. He hauls off and whacks  one - big hitter, the Lama - long, into a ten-thousand foot crevasse, right at the base of this gla cier. Do you know what the Lama says? Gunga galunga... gunga, gunga-lagunga. So we finish the eighte enth and he's gonna stiff me. And I say, "Hey, Lama, hey, how about a little something, you know, fo r the effort, you know." And he says, "Oh, uh, there won't be any money, but when you die, on your d eathbed, you will receive total consciousness." So I got that goin' for me, which is nice.
